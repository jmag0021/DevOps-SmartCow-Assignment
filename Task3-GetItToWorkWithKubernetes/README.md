### Task 3 - Get it to work with Kubernetes

Next step is completely separate from step 2. Go back to the application you built in Stage 1 and get it to work with Kubernetes.

Separate out the two containers into separate pods, communicate between the two containers, add a load balancer (or equivalent), expose the final App over port 80 to the final user (and any other tertiary tasks you might need to do)

Add all the deployments, services and volume (if any) yaml files in the repo.

The only hard-requirement is to get the app to work with `minikube`
