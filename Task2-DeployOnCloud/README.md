## Task 2 - Deploy on Cloud

Next step is to deploy this application to absolutely any cloud of your choice. 

> It's important to remember here that the application is already containerize, maybe you could deploy it to services which take an advantage of that fact. (example, AWS EBS?)

You could use any other cloud service provider of your choice too. Use the smallest instance size available to save up on the cloud costs. 

The React App should be accessible on a public URL, that's the only hard requirement. 

Use the best practices for exposing the cloud VM to the internet, block access to unused ports, add a static IP (elastic IP for AWS), create proper IAM users and configure the app exactly how you would in production. Write a small document to explain your approach.

You will be evaluated based on the

* best practices
* quality of the documentation provided with the code
